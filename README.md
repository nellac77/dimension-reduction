A look at some feature extraction techniques

## In this repository we will cover:
+ Principle Component Analysis (PCA)
+ Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)
+ Kernel PCA
+ Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA)

The above feature extraction techniques compliment "feature selection" as part of the techniques aimed at dimensionality reduction of data sets. Other feature selection techniques include backward elimination, forward selection, bidirectional elimination, and score comparison, among others.
